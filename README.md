MLPN (Machine Learning Procedure for Normality) is a machine learning algorithm designed to assess whether a dataset is drawn from a normal distribution. 
MLPN functions as a classification algorithm, determining whether a data sample follows a normal distribution. 
This approach is proposed as an alternative to traditional normality tests in the literature. 
Developed using the CatBoost algorithm, it utilizes descriptive statistics as features. 
Monte Carlo simulation studies demonstrate that MLPN outperforms other normality tests in terms of Type I error and power measures in most cases.
